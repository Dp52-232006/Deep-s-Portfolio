                <h1> Air Pollution: Website</h1>
                <p>Using html and css only, I made a website that had information on air pollution and how it can be
                    addressed locally in our community. Air Pollution is a common issue we currently face today and by creating this website it enlightens the user to how much of an impact air pollution has on today's society and what things they themselves can do to contribute to the goal or outcome. </p>

                how you will go about escaping or your fate. </p>
